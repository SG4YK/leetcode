 * Testcase Example:  '"the sky is blue"'
 *
 * Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "the sky is blue"
 * Output: "blue is sky the"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "  hello world!  "
 * Output: "world! hello"
 * Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing
 * spaces.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "a good   example"
 * Output: "example good a"
 * Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a
 * single space in the reversed string.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
 * Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed
 * string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 * You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in
 * the reversed string.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.
